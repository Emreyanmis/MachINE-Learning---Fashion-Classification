# Machine-Learning---Fashion-Classification
This project creates a virtual stylist assistant that looks at customers'  Facebook,Instagram,Twitter, and Pinterest images and classifies what fashion category they are wearing either bags dresses and pants. The virtual assistant can help the retailer detect and forecast fashion trends and launch targeted marketing campaigns.
